Array is a data structure which contains  elements of same datatype as shown below.

arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

arr_string = ["prasanna","praveen","sagar","rajamohan","manoj"]

but the lists in python can be used to store heterogenous collection of elements.In a single list we can stores int,string,char etc.

In array the elements are stored in contagious memory allocations.But we are not able to predict the address of the array where it is
stored. But we can access these elements using the index of the array.
